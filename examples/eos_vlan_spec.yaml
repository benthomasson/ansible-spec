short_description: Manage the collection of local uesrs on Arista EOS devices
description:
  - This module provides declarative management of the local usernames
    configured on Arista EOS devices.  It allows playbooks to manage
    either individual usernames or the collection of usernames in the
    current running config.  It also supports purging usernames from the
    configuration that are not explicitly defined.
supports_check_mode: True
notes: null
requirements: null
options:
  users:
    description:
      - The set of username objects to be configured on the remote
        Arista EOS device.  The list entries can either be the username
        or a hash of username and properties.  This argument is mutually
        exclusive with the C(username) argument.
    required: false
    default: null
    type: list
  username:
    description:
      - The username to be configured on the remote Arista EOS
        device.  This argument accepts a stringv value and is mutually
        exclusive with the C(users) argument.
    required: false
    default: null
    type: str
  update_password:
    description:
      - Since passwords are encrypted in the device running config, this
        argument will instruct the module when to change the password.  When
        set to C(always), the password will always be updated in the device
        and when set to C(on_create) the password will be updated only if
        the username is created.
    required: false
    default: always
    choices: ['on_create', 'always']
    type: str
  privilege:
    description:
      - The C(privilege) argument configures the privilege level of the
        user when logged into the system.  This argument accepts integer
        values in the range of 1 to 15.
    required: false
    default: null
    type: int
  role:
    description:
      - The C(role) argument configures the role for the username in the
        device running configuration.  The argument accepts a string value
        defining the role name.  This argument does not check if the role
        has been configured on the device.
  sshkey:
    description:
      - The C(sshkey) argument defines the SSH public key to configure
        for the username.  This argument accepts a valid SSH key value.
    required: false
    default: null
  nopassword:
    description:
      - The C(nopassword) argument defines the username without assigning
        a password.  This will allow the user to login to the system
        without being authenticated by a password.  This argument accepts
        boolean values.
    required: false
    default: null
    choices: ['true', 'false']
    type: bool
  purge:
    description:
      - The C(purge) argument instructs the module to consider the
        resource definition absolute.  It will remove any previously
        configured usernames on the device with the exception of the
        `admin` user which cannot be deleted per EOS constraints.
    required: false
    default: false
    type: bool
  state:
    description:
      - The C(state) argument configures the state of the uername definition
        as it relates to the device operational configuration.  When set
        to I(present), the username(s) should be configured in the device active
        configuration and when set to I(absent) the username(s) should not be
        in the device active configuration
    required: false
    default: present
    choices: ['present', 'absent']
